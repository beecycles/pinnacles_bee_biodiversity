# Pinnacles_Bee_Biodiversity
We resurveyed Pinnacles National Park for native bee species and compared results to bee inventories completed 10 and 15 years earlier, as well as similar efforts conducted across the U.S.

The manuscript for this publication is currently in review. Stay tuned for more results.
